                  <h1>Introduction to solar system</h1>
                  <p>
                    The solar system is made up of the Sun and everything that revolves or moves around it. This comprises the eight planets and their moons, as well as dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and other tiny, icy objects. Despite this, the majority of the solar system is in space.
    
    The solar system is merely a small fraction of the Milky Way galaxy, which is a vast structure of stars and other objects. Every 225 million years, the solar system circles the centre of the galaxy. The Milky Way galaxy is simply one of the billions of galaxies that comprise the universe as a whole.

    Solar System
    
    
    The solar system also includes eight planets, which are enormous, almost spherical objects that round the Sun in elliptical trajectories known as orbits. The Earth is also a planet, and it is far enough away from the Sun that it is neither too hot nor too cold for life to survive. Planets originated at least 4.6 billion years ago when dust and gas discs circling the Sun collided and clumped together owing to gravity. Planets are classified into two types:
    
    Rocky Planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are largely formed of solid rock and metal. 
    
    Gas Giants: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are composed primarily of gases such as hydrogen, helium, and methane. These planets are much larger than the rocky worlds.
    
    
    The solar system also contains asteroids, which are tiny irregularly shaped objects composed of rock, metal, and carbon that circle the Sun. The asteroid belt contains the majority of these objects, which orbit between Mars and Jupiter.
    
    
    Solar System All Planets Name
    Planets circle the Sun in elliptical orbits, with the Sun slightly off-centre of each ellipse. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are the eight planets.
    
    
    SUN: The biggest star in our solar system, accounting for 99.8% of its mass. It emits the majority of the heat and light that allow life to exist on Earth and potentially beyond.
                    solar system, assemblage consisting of the Sun—an average star in the Milky Way Galaxy—and those bodies orbiting around it: 8 (formerly 9) planets with more than 210 known planetary satellites (moons); many asteroids, some with their own satellites; comets and other icy bodies; and vast reaches of highly tenuous gas and dust known as the interplanetary medium.
    
    The Sun, Moon, and brightest planets were visible to the naked eyes of ancient astronomers, and their observations and calculations of the movements of these bodies gave rise to the science of astronomy. Today the amount of information on the motions, properties, and compositions of the planets and smaller bodies has grown to immense proportions, and the range of observational instruments has extended far beyond the solar system to other galaxies and the edge of the known universe. Yet the solar system and its immediate outer boundary still represent the limit of our physical reach, and they remain the core of our theoretical understanding of the cosmos as well. Earth-launched space probes and landers have gathered data on planets, moons, asteroids, and other bodies, and this data has been added to the measurements collected with telescopes and other instruments from below and above Earth’s atmosphere and to the information extracted from meteorites and from Moon rocks returned by astronauts. All this information is scrutinized in attempts to understand in detail the origin and evolution of the solar system—a goal toward which astronomers continue to make great strides.

                MERCURY: Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system, measuring only slightly bigger than Earth's Moon and travelling around the Sun in only 88 days. The atmosphere of Mercury is extremely thin and mostly consists of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. Because its atmosphere is so thin that it cannot absorb incoming meteors, its surface is dotted with craters, much like our moon's

Venus is sometimes known as Earth's twin since it is so similar to Earth in terms of size and density. Venus's atmosphere is thick and poisonous, filled with carbon dioxide. The planet is usually covered in dense clouds of yellowish sulfuric acid. Venus has the highest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system, at roughly 475 degrees Celsius.

Mars' terrain is rocky, with mountains, valleys, and canyons, as well as storm systems ranging from small tornado-like dust devils to planet-engulfing dust storms.


                Significant scientific evidence shows that Mars was once a much warmer, wetter environment, with rivers and maybe even seas. Although Mars' atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to persist on the surface for an extended period, traces of a wetter Mars can still be seen today.

It rotates from east to west, similar to Venus. However, unlike Venus or any other planet, its equator is roughly perpendicular to its orbit – it effectively circles on its side. 


                The impact may have also sent rock and ice into Uranus' orbit. These were eventually transformed into some of the planet's 27 moons. Uranus' blue-green hue is due to methane in its atmosphere. It also contains 13 faint ring sets.

            Black holes form natural time machines that allow travel to both
            the past and the future. But don’t expect to be heading back to
            visit the dinosaurs any time soon. At present, we don’t have
            spacecraft that could get us anywhere near a black hole. But,
            even leaving that small detail aside, attempting to travel into
            the past using a black hole might be the last thing you ever do.
            What are black holes? A black hole is an extremely massive
            object that is typically formed when a dying star collapses in
            on itself. Like planets and stars, black holes have
            gravitational fields around them. A gravitational field is what
            keeps us stuck to Earth, and what keeps Earth revolving around
            the Sun. As a rule of thumb, the more massive an object is, the
            stronger its gravitational field. Earth’s gravitational field
            makes it extremely difficult to get to space. That’s why we
            build rockets: we have to travel very fast to break out of
            Earth’s gravity. The gravitational field of a black hole is so
            strong that even light can’t escape it. That’s impressive, since
            light is the fastest thing known to science! Incidentally,
            that’s why black holes are black: we can’t bounce light off a
            black hole the way we might bounce a torch light off a tree in
            the dark. Related Stories Digantara launches second satellite to
            monitor space weather Through its platform, Digantara develops
            end-to-end infrastructure to address the difficulties in space
            operations READ NOW Stretching space Albert Einstein’s general
            theory of relativity tells us matter and energy have a curious
            effect on the universe. Matter and energy bend and stretch
            space. The more massive an object is, the more space is
            stretched and bent around it. A massive object creates a kind of
            valley in space. When objects come near, they fall into the
            valley. That’s why, when you get close enough to any massive
            object, including a black hole, you fall toward it. It’s also
            why light can’t escape a black hole: the sides of the valley are
            so steep that light isn’t going fast enough to climb out. The
            valley created by a black hole gets steeper and steeper as you
            approach it from a distance. The point at which it gets so steep
            that light can’t escape is called the event horizon. Event
            horizons aren’t just interesting for would-be time travellers:
            they’re also interesting for philosophers because they have
            implications for how we understand the nature of time.
            Stretching time When space is stretched, so is time. A clock
            that is near a massive object will tick slower than one that is
            near a much less massive object. A clock near a black hole will
            tick very slowly compared to one on Earth. One year near a black
            hole could mean 80 years on Earth, as you may have seen
            illustrated in the movie Interstellar. In this way, black holes
            can be used to travel to the future. If you want to jump into
            the future of Earth, simply fly near a black hole and then
            return to Earth. If you get close enough to the centre of the
            black hole, your clock will tick slower, but you should still be
            able to escape so long as you don’t cross the event horizon.
            Loops in time What about the past? This is where things get
            truly interesting. A black hole bends time so much that it can
            wrap back on itself. Imagine taking a sheet of paper and joining
            the two ends to form a loop. That’s what a black hole seems to
            do to time. This creates a natural time machine. If you could
            somehow get onto the loop, which physicists call a closed
            timelike curve, you would find yourself on a trajectory through
            space that starts in the future and ends in the past. Inside the
            loop, you would also find that cause and effect get hard to
            untangle. Things that are in the past cause things to happen in
            the future, which in turn cause things to happen in the past!
            The catch So, you’ve found a black hole and you want to use your
            trusty spaceship to go back and visit the dinosaurs. Good luck.
            There are three problems. First, you can only travel into the
            black hole’s past. That means that if the black hole was created
            after the dinosaurs died out, then you won’t be able to go back
            far enough. Second, you’d probably have to cross the event
            horizon to get into the loop. This means that to get out of the
            loop at a particular time in the past, you’d need to exit the
            event horizon. That means travelling faster than light, which
            we’re pretty sure is impossible.

            NASA, Pentagon developing nuclear-powered rocket for Mars voyage
          </h1>
          <p>
            Share this article Whatsapp Facebook Twitter Linkedin News Desk
            (AFP) Washington, United States ● Thu, January 26, 2023 NASA is
            partnering with a Pentagon research agency to develop a
            nuclear-powered rocket engine in preparation for sending
            astronauts to Mars. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday
            that the US space agency will team up with the Defense Advanced
            Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to "develop and demonstrate
            advanced nuclear thermal propulsion technology as soon as 2027."
            "With the help of this new technology, astronauts could journey
            to and from deep space faster than ever –- a major capability to
            prepare for crewed missions to Mars," Nelson said in a
            statement. DARPA is the Pentagon's research and development arm
            and has played a role in many of the notable innovations of the
            20th century including the internet. NASA said nuclear thermal
            rockets can be three or more times more efficient than
            conventional chemical propulsion and would reduce transit time,
            essential for an eventual mission to Mars. In a nuclear thermal
            engine, a fission reactor is used to generate extremely high
            temperatures. Heat from the reactor is transferred to liquid
            propellant which is then converted into gas, which expands
            through a nozzle and provides thrust. "DARPA and NASA have a
            long history of fruitful collaboration," DARPA director Stefanie
            Tompkins said, citing the Saturn V rocket that took the first
            astronauts to the Moon. "The nuclear thermal rocket program will
            be essential for more efficiently and quickly transporting
            material to the Moon and, eventually, people to Mars," Tompkins
            said. NASA conducted its last nuclear thermal rocket engine
            tests more than 50 years ago but the program was abandoned due
            to budget cuts and Cold War tensions.

          <h1>Global timekeepers vote to scrap leap second by 2035</h1>
          <p>
            Scientists and government representatives meeting at a
            conference in France voted on Friday to scrap leap seconds by
            2035, the organization responsible for global timekeeping said.
            Similar to leap years, leap seconds have been periodically added
            to clocks over the last half century to make up for the
            difference between exact atomic time and the Earth's slower
            rotation. While leap seconds pass by unnoticed for most people,
            they can cause problems for a range of systems that require an
            exact, uninterrupted flow of time, such as satellite navigation,
            software, telecommunication, trade and even space travel. It has
            caused a headache for the International Bureau of Weights and
            Measures (BIPM), which is responsible for Coordinated Universal
            Time (UTC)—the internationally agreed standard by which the
            world sets its clocks. A resolution to stop adding leap seconds
            by 2035 was passed by the BIPM's 59 member states and other
            parties at the General Conference on Weights and Measures, which
            is held roughly every four years at the Versailles Palace west
            of Paris. The head of BIPM's time department, Patrizia Tavella,
            told AFP that the "historic decision" would allow "a continuous
            flow of seconds without the discontinuities currently caused by
            irregular leap seconds". "The change will be effective by or
            before 2035," she said via email. She said that Russia voted
            against the resolution, "not on principle", but because Moscow
            wanted to push the date it comes into force until 2040. Other
            countries had called for a quicker timeframe such as 2025 or
            2030, so the "best compromise" was 2035, she said. The United
            States and France were among the countries leading the way for
            the change. Tavella emphasized that "the connection between UTC
            and the rotation of the Earth is not lost". "Nothing will
            change" for the public, she added. A leap minute? Seconds were
            long measured by astronomers analyzing the Earth's rotation,
            however the advent of atomic clocks—which use the frequency of
            atoms as their tick-tock mechanism—ushered in a far more precise
            era of timekeeping. But Earth's slightly slower rotation means
            the two times are out of sync. To bridge the gap, leap seconds
            were introduced in 1972, and 27 have been added at irregular
            intervals since—the last in 2016. Under the proposal, leap
            seconds will continue to be added as normal for the time being.
            But by 2035, the difference between atomic and astronomical time
            will be allowed to grow to a value larger than one second, Judah
            Levine, a physicist at the US National Institute of Standards
            and Technology, told AFP. "The larger value is yet to be
            determined," said Levine, who spent years helping draft the
            resolution alongside Tavella. Negotiations will be held to find
            a proposal by 2035 to determine that value and how it will be
            handled, according to the resolution. Levine said it was
            important to protect UTC time because it is run by "a worldwide
            community effort" in the BIPM. GPS time, a potential UTC rival
            governed by atomic clocks, is run by the US military "without
            worldwide oversight", Levine said. A possible solution to the
            problem could be letting the discrepancy between the Earth's
            rotation and atomic time build up to a minute. It is difficult
            to say exactly how long that might take, but Levine estimated
            anywhere between 50 to 100 years. Instead of then adding on a
            leap minute to clocks, Levine proposed a "kind of smear", in
            which the last minute of the day takes two minutes. "The advance
            of a clock slows, but never stops," he said.

            A novel, space-time coding antenna promotes 6G and secure
            wireless communications
          </h1>
          <p>
            A research team co-led by a scientist at City University of Hong
            Kong (CityU) has developed a novel antenna that allows
            manipulation of the direction, frequency and amplitude of the
            radiated beam, and is expected to play an important role in the
            integration of sensing and communications (ISAC) for
            6th-generation (6G) wireless communications. advertisement The
            structure and characteristics of traditional antennas cannot be
            changed once fabricated. However, the direction, frequency, and
            amplitude of the electromagnetic waves from this new-generation
            antenna, which is called a "sideband-free space-time-coding
            (STC) metasurface antenna," can be changed through space-time
            coding (i.e. software control), enabling great user flexibility.
            The key to this innovative feature is that the response of the
            metasurface (artificial, thin-sheet material with sub-wavelength
            thickness and made of several sub-wavelength meta-atoms) can be
            changed by switching the meta-atoms on its surface between
            radiating and non-radiating states, like turning on and off
            switches, by controlling the electric current. This allows the
            STC metasurface antenna to realize complicated wave manipulation
            in the space and frequency domains through software control, and
            to create a desired radiation pattern and a highly directed
            beam. Professor Chan Chi-hou, Acting Provost and Chair Professor
            of Electronic Engineering in the Department of Electrical
            Engineering at CityU, who led the research, highlighted that the
            antenna relies on the successful combination of two research
            advances, namely amplitude-modulated (AM) leaky-wave antennas
            and space-time coding techniques. Dr Wu Gengbo, postdoctoral
            fellow in the State Key Laboratory of Terahertz and Millimeter
            Waves (SKLTMW) at CityU, first proposed the new concept of AM
            leaky-wave antennas in 2020 in his PhD studies at CityU. "The
            concept provides an analytical approach to synthesize antennas
            with the desired radiation patterns for different specific uses
            by simply changing the antennas' shape and structure," explained
            Dr Wu. But as with other antennas, once the AM leaky-wave
            antenna is fabricated, its radiation characteristics are fixed.
            At about that time, Dr Dai Junyan, from a research group led by
            Academician Cui Tiejun and Professor Cheng Qiang, from Southeast
            University at Nanjing, China, who pioneered STC technologies,
            joined Professor Chan's group at CityU. "Dr Dai's expertise in
            space-time coding and digital metasurfaces to dynamically
            reconfigure antenna performance added a new, important dimension
            to the antenna research at the SKLTMW," said Professor Chan, who
            is also Director of the SKLTMW at CityU.

            A Bacterial Enzyme That Copies DNA Might Make More Mistakes in
            Zero Gravity, Study Finds
          </h1>
          <p>
            An enzyme in the bacterium E. coli made more errors copying
            synthetic DNA when exposed to zero gravity than the same enzyme
            did in normal gravity, a recent study finds. The paper raises
            the possibility that some enzymes work differently in space
            compared to on Earth. "It gives us an idea that enzymes, like
            polymerases or others that are involved in maintaining the
            integrity of our DNA, may be influenced by spaceflight," said
            Susan Bailey, a radiation cancer biologist at Colorado State
            University in Fort Collins who has studied DNA damage caused by
            space radiation and did not contribute to the new paper. Aaron
            Rosenstein, lead author of the paper and a bioengineering
            graduate student at the University of Toronto, said the finding
            "warrants further investigation into other enzymes that are
            involved in crucial pathways that are inherent to life and
            survival." Scientists know that spending long periods of time in
            space can affect astronauts' physiology and cause health
            problems. Microgravity can cause muscle atrophy, a loss of bone
            density, and vision problems. It can also cause the brain and
            cerebrospinal fluid to shift, and it might be linked to brain
            damage. While in space, astronauts are also exposed to radiation
            from the sun and distant galaxies. "Radiation kind of acts like
            a bowling ball, and the DNA is the bowling pins," said
            Rosenstein. "These particles move so fast that they break DNA
            apart or they cause mutations through all these different
            mechanisms." This damage to DNA can potentially put astronauts
            at increased risk for cancer and degenerative diseases, said
            Bailey. Rosenstein said it's less clear what effect, if any,
            microgravity might have on DNA. He studies DNA polymerases, a
            class of enzymes that copy DNA and repair damage. Polymerases
            read the order in which the four types of nucleotide bases are
            arranged on the original strand of DNA and place the matching
            base on the corresponding section of the new strand. But these
            polymerases aren't perfect, so some have proofreading enzymes
            attached that double-check their work and note where they've
            made a mistake.

            Spinning Propeller Star Slingshots Plasma at 7 Million MPH
          </h1>
          <p>
            Astronomers have detected the fastest-spinning white dwarf star
            found yet -- one that researchers say acts like an
            extraordinarily powerful magnetic propeller, a new study finds.
            White dwarfs are stars that have burnt up all their fuel and
            shed their outer layers, leaving behind their cool, dim cores.
            Our sun will one day become a white dwarf, as will more than 90%
            of the stars in the Milky Way. In the new study, researchers
            analyzed the white dwarf in the binary star system LAMOST
            J024048.51+195226.9. The white dwarf is a stellar remnant about
            2,015 light-years from Earth that is roughly our planet's size
            but at least 230,000 times its mass. The researchers imaged the
            spinning of the star using the highly sensitive HiPERCAM
            instrument on the largest functioning optical telescope in the
            world, the 10-meter-wide Gran Telescopio Canarias in Spain's
            Canary Islands. The white dwarf's powerful gravity yanks plasma
            off its larger companion, a red dwarf star. In the past, this
            material fell onto the white dwarf's equator at high speed,
            resulting in its extraordinarily fast spin. The white dwarf also
            possesses a strong magnetic field, which acts like a protective
            barrier that causes most of the plasma falling onto it to blast
            out from the dead star at speeds of roughly 6.7 million mph.
            This makes this stellar remnant only the second "magnetic
            propeller" white dwarf ever found, more than 70 years since the
            first. Any plasma that doesn't get propelled away from
            J0240+1952 flows toward the white dwarf's magnetic poles. It
            gathers in bright spots on the white dwarf's surface, and as
            these rotate in and out of view from Earth, astronomers observe
            pulses of light, which they use to measure the white dwarf's
            rate of spin. All in all, the white dwarf completes one full
            rotation in a record-breaking 25 seconds. That is nearly 20%
            faster than the next fastest-spinning white dwarf, which
            completes a revolution in just over 29 seconds. "Put into
            Earth's perspective, it is like the day only lasted for 25
            seconds," said study lead author Ingrid Pelisoli, an
            astrophysicist at the University of Warwick in England. These
            findings help support theoretical predictions of how magnetic
            propellers should behave, which scientists had not been able to
            confirm until they found a second example of one. "I find it
            very satisfactory to find exactly what you expected," Pelisoli
            said. The scientists detailed their findings online Nov. 22 in
            the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

          <h1>Our Solar System's Centaurs Are Half-Asteroid, Half-Comet</h1>
          <p>
            Centaurs are among the strangest objects in the solar system.
            The first, dubbed Chiron, was spotted orbiting more than a
            billion miles from the sun in 1977 and was originally thought to
            be an asteroid. But a few years later it was seen emitting a
            halo of gas -- a "coma" -- and a tail like a comet. This dual
            nature gave these weird objects their name: Seemingly
            half-asteroid and half-comet, they were dubbed "centaurs" after
            the half-human, half-horse creatures of Greek myths. More than a
            thousand centaurs have now been found, and scientists have
            discovered a little more about them, although at such distances
            they remain mysterious. But centaurs may hold a key to
            understanding how the sun and its planets originally formed from
            clouds of interstellar gas. Although the full journey hasn't yet
            been seen, scientists think centaurs start out as Kuiper Belt
            objects, or KBOs -- the "dirty snowballs," now thought to be as
            much dirt as snow, that orbit the sun far beyond Neptune –
            between 2.7 billion and 4.6 billion miles from the sun.
            Scientists estimate there are millions of KBOs; many are less
            than 10 miles across but some are much larger, and the
            designation includes Pluto and other distant dwarf planets that
            are thought to have formed when multitudes of smaller KBOs
            clumped together. KBOs are interesting to scientists in part
            because they are thought to be the frozen remnants of the
            protoplanetary disk of dust and gas that formed our solar
            system. "I like to call them the dinosaur bones of the solar
            system," said planetary astronomer Carey Lisse of Johns Hopkins
            University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.
            "They are roughly equal amounts of ices and rock, which is what
            we think is the original recipe for building the planets." Most
            KBOs are so small and so distant that they are difficult to
            study. But any KBOs that get closer to the sun -- such as
            centaurs -- can give scientists a better chance to observe them
            and better understand the formation of the entire solar system,
            Lisse said. Most centaurs are dislodged from the Kuiper Belt by
            the gravity of Neptune and may take millions of years to spiral
            into the "centaur zone" between Neptune and Jupiter. Once there
            they can ricochet between the giant planets. "You can kind of
            imagine it as a giant pinball machine," explained Eva Lilly, a
            research scientist for the Planetary Science Institute who lives
            in South Carolina. "They get passed around between one of the
            big planets, from Neptune to Uranus, then from Uranus to Saturn,
            and so on -- and each of these interactions can alter their
            orbits more and more." Lilly is the lead author of a study
            published recently in the Planetary Science Journal that
            examined 13 of the closest centaurs to learn about their
            often-sporadic cometlike activity. "They are really
            unpredictable," she said. "We don't really know when they will
            turn on and turn off." Just as Sherlock Holmes once solved a
            mystery because a dog didn't bark, Lilly found a clue about the
            centaurs' composition from their lack of activity. Although the
            centaurs were observed near their closest approach to the sun,
            they didn't show any cometlike behavior -- which suggests their
            occasional activity is triggered by something other than the sun
            directly heating up their ice until it turns into vapor, a
            process called sublimation. And Lilly thinks she knows what that
            could be. Some models of centaurs suggest they contain amorphous
            water ice -- a type of ice without crystalline structure that
            can form only in very cold environments, and never here on
            Earth. Amorphous ice can trap gases like carbon monoxide between
            its molecules -- and Lilly suggests centaur activity is caused
            at relatively low temperatures by the trapped gases released by
            the transition of water ice from its amorphous to its
            crystalline form, rather than by the direct sublimation of ices.
            Comets aren't active until they're relatively near the sun, but
            the amorphous to crystalline transition of water ice can happen
            as far out as the orbit of Saturn -- about 890 million miles
            from the sun. The release of gases from the transition could
            cause sinkholes or landslides on the centaur's surface, in turn
            exposing chemically lightweight ices that sublimate in even
            feeble sunshine in a sudden outburst or explosion: "There have
            been centaurs in the past where we've seen this process," Lilly
            said. "This is what we think is happening." Lisse, whose
            research has included a study of centaurs, comets and Kuiper
            Belt objects with the Spitzer space telescope, said centaurs
            have only a few million years before they fall into a giant
            planet -- usually Jupiter -- or sneak into the inner solar
            system to become comets. The lighter ices forming the bulk of
            the comets are then sublimed near the sun -- "burned away," as
            he put it -- while the centaurs between Jupiter and Neptune
            still have much the same chemical composition as they did in the
            Kuiper Belt. That means that studying centaurs with spectroscopy
            or even space missions can give insights into the solar system's
            original composition: "I'm trying to figure out the recipe for
            the things that built the planets," Lisse said. "I want to know
            what was the original source."

          <h1>Are black holes time machines? Yes, but there's a catch.</h1>
          <p>
            Black holes form natural time machines that allow travel to both
            the past and the future. But don’t expect to be heading back to
            visit the dinosaurs any time soon. At present, we don’t have
            spacecraft that could get us anywhere near a black hole. But,
            even leaving that small detail aside, attempting to travel into
            the past using a black hole might be the last thing you ever do.
            What are black holes? A black hole is an extremely massive
            object that is typically formed when a dying star collapses in
            on itself. Like planets and stars, black holes have
            gravitational fields around them. A gravitational field is what
            keeps us stuck to Earth, and what keeps Earth revolving around
            the Sun. As a rule of thumb, the more massive an object is, the
            stronger its gravitational field. Earth’s gravitational field
            makes it extremely difficult to get to space. That’s why we
            build rockets: we have to travel very fast to break out of
            Earth’s gravity. The gravitational field of a black hole is so
            strong that even light can’t escape it. That’s impressive, since
            light is the fastest thing known to science! Incidentally,
            that’s why black holes are black: we can’t bounce light off a
            black hole the way we might bounce a torch light off a tree in
            the dark. Related Stories Digantara launches second satellite to
            monitor space weather Through its platform, Digantara develops
            end-to-end infrastructure to address the difficulties in space
            operations READ NOW Stretching space Albert Einstein’s general
            theory of relativity tells us matter and energy have a curious
            effect on the universe. Matter and energy bend and stretch
            space. The more massive an object is, the more space is
            stretched and bent around it. A massive object creates a kind of
            valley in space. When objects come near, they fall into the
            valley. That’s why, when you get close enough to any massive
            object, including a black hole, you fall toward it. It’s also
            why light can’t escape a black hole: the sides of the valley are
            so steep that light isn’t going fast enough to climb out. The
            valley created by a black hole gets steeper and steeper as you
            approach it from a distance. The point at which it gets so steep
            that light can’t escape is called the event horizon. Event
            horizons aren’t just interesting for would-be time travellers:
            they’re also interesting for philosophers because they have
            implications for how we understand the nature of time.
            Stretching time When space is stretched, so is time. A clock
            that is near a massive object will tick slower than one that is
            near a much less massive object. A clock near a black hole will
            tick very slowly compared to one on Earth. One year near a black
            hole could mean 80 years on Earth, as you may have seen
            illustrated in the movie Interstellar. In this way, black holes
            can be used to travel to the future. If you want to jump into
            the future of Earth, simply fly near a black hole and then
            return to Earth. If you get close enough to the centre of the
            black hole, your clock will tick slower, but you should still be
            able to escape so long as you don’t cross the event horizon.
            Loops in time What about the past? This is where things get
            truly interesting. A black hole bends time so much that it can
            wrap back on itself. Imagine taking a sheet of paper and joining
            the two ends to form a loop. That’s what a black hole seems to
            do to time. This creates a natural time machine. If you could
            somehow get onto the loop, which physicists call a closed
            timelike curve, you would find yourself on a trajectory through
            space that starts in the future and ends in the past. Inside the
            loop, you would also find that cause and effect get hard to
            untangle. Things that are in the past cause things to happen in
            the future, which in turn cause things to happen in the past!
            The catch So, you’ve found a black hole and you want to use your
            trusty spaceship to go back and visit the dinosaurs. Good luck.
            There are three problems. First, you can only travel into the
            black hole’s past. That means that if the black hole was created
            after the dinosaurs died out, then you won’t be able to go back
            far enough. Second, you’d probably have to cross the event
            horizon to get into the loop. This means that to get out of the
            loop at a particular time in the past, you’d need to exit the
            event horizon. That means travelling faster than light, which
            we’re pretty sure is impossible.

            NASA, Pentagon developing nuclear-powered rocket for Mars voyage

            (AFP) Washington, United States ● Thu, January 26, 2023 NASA is
            partnering with a Pentagon research agency to develop a
            nuclear-powered rocket engine in preparation for sending
            astronauts to Mars. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday
            that the US space agency will team up with the Defense Advanced
            Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to "develop and demonstrate
            advanced nuclear thermal propulsion technology as soon as 2027."
            "With the help of this new technology, astronauts could journey
            to and from deep space faster than ever –- a major capability to
            prepare for crewed missions to Mars," Nelson said in a
            statement. DARPA is the Pentagon's research and development arm
            and has played a role in many of the notable innovations of the
            20th century including the internet. NASA said nuclear thermal
            rockets can be three or more times more efficient than
            conventional chemical propulsion and would reduce transit time,
            essential for an eventual mission to Mars. In a nuclear thermal
            engine, a fission reactor is used to generate extremely high
            temperatures. Heat from the reactor is transferred to liquid
            propellant which is then converted into gas, which expands
            through a nozzle and provides thrust. "DARPA and NASA have a
            long history of fruitful collaboration," DARPA director Stefanie
            Tompkins said, citing the Saturn V rocket that took the first
            astronauts to the Moon. "The nuclear thermal rocket program will
            be essential for more efficiently and quickly transporting
            material to the Moon and, eventually, people to Mars," Tompkins
            said. NASA conducted its last nuclear thermal rocket engine
            tests more than 50 years ago but the program was abandoned due
            to budget cuts and Cold War tensions.

          <h1>Global timekeepers vote to scrap leap second by 2035</h1>
          <p>
            Scientists and government representatives meeting at a
            conference in France voted on Friday to scrap leap seconds by
            2035, the organization responsible for global timekeeping said.
            Similar to leap years, leap seconds have been periodically added
            to clocks over the last half century to make up for the
            difference between exact atomic time and the Earth's slower
            rotation. While leap seconds pass by unnoticed for most people,
            they can cause problems for a range of systems that require an
            exact, uninterrupted flow of time, such as satellite navigation,
            software, telecommunication, trade and even space travel. It has
            caused a headache for the International Bureau of Weights and
            Measures (BIPM), which is responsible for Coordinated Universal
            Time (UTC)—the internationally agreed standard by which the
            world sets its clocks. A resolution to stop adding leap seconds
            by 2035 was passed by the BIPM's 59 member states and other
            parties at the General Conference on Weights and Measures, which
            is held roughly every four years at the Versailles Palace west
            of Paris. The head of BIPM's time department, Patrizia Tavella,
            told AFP that the "historic decision" would allow "a continuous
            flow of seconds without the discontinuities currently caused by
            irregular leap seconds". "The change will be effective by or
            before 2035," she said via email. She said that Russia voted
            against the resolution, "not on principle", but because Moscow
            wanted to push the date it comes into force until 2040. Other
            countries had called for a quicker timeframe such as 2025 or
            2030, so the "best compromise" was 2035, she said. The United
            States and France were among the countries leading the way for
            the change. Tavella emphasized that "the connection between UTC
            and the rotation of the Earth is not lost". "Nothing will
            change" for the public, she added. A leap minute? Seconds were
            long measured by astronomers analyzing the Earth's rotation,
            however the advent of atomic clocks—which use the frequency of
            atoms as their tick-tock mechanism—ushered in a far more precise
            era of timekeeping. But Earth's slightly slower rotation means
            the two times are out of sync. To bridge the gap, leap seconds
            were introduced in 1972, and 27 have been added at irregular
            intervals since—the last in 2016. Under the proposal, leap
            seconds will continue to be added as normal for the time being.
            But by 2035, the difference between atomic and astronomical time
            will be allowed to grow to a value larger than one second, Judah
            Levine, a physicist at the US National Institute of Standards
            and Technology, told AFP. "The larger value is yet to be
            determined," said Levine, who spent years helping draft the
            resolution alongside Tavella. Negotiations will be held to find
            a proposal by 2035 to determine that value and how it will be
            handled, according to the resolution. Levine said it was
            important to protect UTC time because it is run by "a worldwide
            community effort" in the BIPM. GPS time, a potential UTC rival
            governed by atomic clocks, is run by the US military "without
            worldwide oversight", Levine said. A possible solution to the
            problem could be letting the discrepancy between the Earth's
            rotation and atomic time build up to a minute. It is difficult
            to say exactly how long that might take, but Levine estimated
            anywhere between 50 to 100 years. Instead of then adding on a
            leap minute to clocks, Levine proposed a "kind of smear", in
            which the last minute of the day takes two minutes. "The advance
            of a clock slows, but never stops," he said.

          <h1>
            A novel, space-time coding antenna promotes 6G and secure
            wireless communications
          </h1>
          <p>
            A research team co-led by a scientist at City University of Hong
            Kong (CityU) has developed a novel antenna that allows
            manipulation of the direction, frequency and amplitude of the
            radiated beam, and is expected to play an important role in the
            integration of sensing and communications (ISAC) for
            6th-generation (6G) wireless communications. advertisement The
            structure and characteristics of traditional antennas cannot be
            changed once fabricated. However, the direction, frequency, and
            amplitude of the electromagnetic waves from this new-generation
            antenna, which is called a "sideband-free space-time-coding
            (STC) metasurface antenna," can be changed through space-time
            coding (i.e. software control), enabling great user flexibility.
            The key to this innovative feature is that the response of the
            metasurface (artificial, thin-sheet material with sub-wavelength
            thickness and made of several sub-wavelength meta-atoms) can be
            changed by switching the meta-atoms on its surface between
            radiating and non-radiating states, like turning on and off
            switches, by controlling the electric current. This allows the
            STC metasurface antenna to realize complicated wave manipulation
            in the space and frequency domains through software control, and
            to create a desired radiation pattern and a highly directed
            beam. Professor Chan Chi-hou, Acting Provost and Chair Professor
            of Electronic Engineering in the Department of Electrical
            Engineering at CityU, who led the research, highlighted that the
            antenna relies on the successful combination of two research
            advances, namely amplitude-modulated (AM) leaky-wave antennas
            and space-time coding techniques. Dr Wu Gengbo, postdoctoral
            fellow in the State Key Laboratory of Terahertz and Millimeter
            Waves (SKLTMW) at CityU, first proposed the new concept of AM
            leaky-wave antennas in 2020 in his PhD studies at CityU. "The
            concept provides an analytical approach to synthesize antennas
            with the desired radiation patterns for different specific uses
            by simply changing the antennas' shape and structure," explained
            Dr Wu. But as with other antennas, once the AM leaky-wave
            antenna is fabricated, its radiation characteristics are fixed.
            At about that time, Dr Dai Junyan, from a research group led by
            Academician Cui Tiejun and Professor Cheng Qiang, from Southeast
            University at Nanjing, China, who pioneered STC technologies,
            joined Professor Chan's group at CityU. "Dr Dai's expertise in
            space-time coding and digital metasurfaces to dynamically
            reconfigure antenna performance added a new, important dimension
            to the antenna research at the SKLTMW," said Professor Chan, who
            is also Director of the SKLTMW at CityU.

            A Bacterial Enzyme That Copies DNA Might Make More Mistakes in
            Zero Gravity, Study Finds
          </h1>
          <p>
            An enzyme in the bacterium E. coli made more errors copying
            synthetic DNA when exposed to zero gravity than the same enzyme
            did in normal gravity, a recent study finds. The paper raises
            the possibility that some enzymes work differently in space
            compared to on Earth. "It gives us an idea that enzymes, like
            polymerases or others that are involved in maintaining the
            integrity of our DNA, may be influenced by spaceflight," said
            Susan Bailey, a radiation cancer biologist at Colorado State
            University in Fort Collins who has studied DNA damage caused by
            space radiation and did not contribute to the new paper. Aaron
            Rosenstein, lead author of the paper and a bioengineering
            graduate student at the University of Toronto, said the finding
            "warrants further investigation into other enzymes that are
            involved in crucial pathways that are inherent to life and
            survival." Scientists know that spending long periods of time in
            space can affect astronauts' physiology and cause health
            problems. Microgravity can cause muscle atrophy, a loss of bone
            density, and vision problems. It can also cause the brain and
            cerebrospinal fluid to shift, and it might be linked to brain
            damage. While in space, astronauts are also exposed to radiation
            from the sun and distant galaxies. "Radiation kind of acts like
            a bowling ball, and the DNA is the bowling pins," said
            Rosenstein. "These particles move so fast that they break DNA
            apart or they cause mutations through all these different
            mechanisms." This damage to DNA can potentially put astronauts
            at increased risk for cancer and degenerative diseases, said
            Bailey. Rosenstein said it's less clear what effect, if any,
            microgravity might have on DNA. He studies DNA polymerases, a
            class of enzymes that copy DNA and repair damage. Polymerases
            read the order in which the four types of nucleotide bases are
            arranged on the original strand of DNA and place the matching
            base on the corresponding section of the new strand. But these
            polymerases aren't perfect, so some have proofreading enzymes
            attached that double-check their work and note where they've
            made a mistake.

            Spinning Propeller Star Slingshots Plasma at 7 Million MPH
          </h1>
          <p>
            Astronomers have detected the fastest-spinning white dwarf star
            found yet -- one that researchers say acts like an
            extraordinarily powerful magnetic propeller, a new study finds.
            White dwarfs are stars that have burnt up all their fuel and
            shed their outer layers, leaving behind their cool, dim cores.
            Our sun will one day become a white dwarf, as will more than 90%
            of the stars in the Milky Way. In the new study, researchers
            analyzed the white dwarf in the binary star system LAMOST
            J024048.51+195226.9. The white dwarf is a stellar remnant about
            2,015 light-years from Earth that is roughly our planet's size
            but at least 230,000 times its mass. The researchers imaged the
            spinning of the star using the highly sensitive HiPERCAM
            instrument on the largest functioning optical telescope in the
            world, the 10-meter-wide Gran Telescopio Canarias in Spain's
            Canary Islands. The white dwarf's powerful gravity yanks plasma
            off its larger companion, a red dwarf star. In the past, this
            material fell onto the white dwarf's equator at high speed,
            resulting in its extraordinarily fast spin. The white dwarf also
            possesses a strong magnetic field, which acts like a protective
            barrier that causes most of the plasma falling onto it to blast
            out from the dead star at speeds of roughly 6.7 million mph.
            This makes this stellar remnant only the second "magnetic
            propeller" white dwarf ever found, more than 70 years since the
            first. Any plasma that doesn't get propelled away from
            J0240+1952 flows toward the white dwarf's magnetic poles. It
            gathers in bright spots on the white dwarf's surface, and as
            these rotate in and out of view from Earth, astronomers observe
            pulses of light, which they use to measure the white dwarf's
            rate of spin. All in all, the white dwarf completes one full
            rotation in a record-breaking 25 seconds. That is nearly 20%
            faster than the next fastest-spinning white dwarf, which
            completes a revolution in just over 29 seconds. "Put into
            Earth's perspective, it is like the day only lasted for 25
            seconds," said study lead author Ingrid Pelisoli, an
            astrophysicist at the University of Warwick in England. These
            findings help support theoretical predictions of how magnetic
            propellers should behave, which scientists had not been able to
            confirm until they found a second example of one. "I find it
            very satisfactory to find exactly what you expected," Pelisoli
            said. The scientists detailed their findings online Nov. 22 in
            the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

          <h1>Our Solar System's Centaurs Are Half-Asteroid, Half-Comet</h1>
          <p>
            Centaurs are among the strangest objects in the solar system.
            The first, dubbed Chiron, was spotted orbiting more than a
            billion miles from the sun in 1977 and was originally thought to
            be an asteroid. But a few years later it was seen emitting a
            halo of gas -- a "coma" -- and a tail like a comet. This dual
            nature gave these weird objects their name: Seemingly
            half-asteroid and half-comet, they were dubbed "centaurs" after
            the half-human, half-horse creatures of Greek myths. More than a
            thousand centaurs have now been found, and scientists have
            discovered a little more about them, although at such distances
            they remain mysterious. But centaurs may hold a key to
            understanding how the sun and its planets originally formed from
            clouds of interstellar gas. Although the full journey hasn't yet
            been seen, scientists think centaurs start out as Kuiper Belt
            objects, or KBOs -- the "dirty snowballs," now thought to be as
            much dirt as snow, that orbit the sun far beyond Neptune –
            between 2.7 billion and 4.6 billion miles from the sun.
            Scientists estimate there are millions of KBOs; many are less
            than 10 miles across but some are much larger, and the
            designation includes Pluto and other distant dwarf planets that
            are thought to have formed when multitudes of smaller KBOs
            clumped together. KBOs are interesting to scientists in part
            because they are thought to be the frozen remnants of the
            protoplanetary disk of dust and gas that formed our solar
            system. "I like to call them the dinosaur bones of the solar
            system," said planetary astronomer Carey Lisse of Johns Hopkins
            University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.
            "They are roughly equal amounts of ices and rock, which is what
            we think is the original recipe for building the planets." Most
            KBOs are so small and so distant that they are difficult to
            study. But any KBOs that get closer to the sun -- such as
            centaurs -- can give scientists a better chance to observe them
            and better understand the formation of the entire solar system,
            Lisse said. Most centaurs are dislodged from the Kuiper Belt by
            the gravity of Neptune and may take millions of years to spiral
            into the "centaur zone" between Neptune and Jupiter. Once there
            they can ricochet between the giant planets. "You can kind of
            imagine it as a giant pinball machine," explained Eva Lilly, a
            research scientist for the Planetary Science Institute who lives
            in South Carolina. "They get passed around between one of the
            big planets, from Neptune to Uranus, then from Uranus to Saturn,
            and so on -- and each of these interactions can alter their
            orbits more and more." Lilly is the lead author of a study
            published recently in the Planetary Science Journal that
            examined 13 of the closest centaurs to learn about their
            often-sporadic cometlike activity. "They are really
            unpredictable," she said. "We don't really know when they will
            turn on and turn off." Just as Sherlock Holmes once solved a
            mystery because a dog didn't bark, Lilly found a clue about the
            centaurs' composition from their lack of activity. Although the
            centaurs were observed near their closest approach to the sun,
            they didn't show any cometlike behavior -- which suggests their
            occasional activity is triggered by something other than the sun
            directly heating up their ice until it turns into vapor, a
            process called sublimation. And Lilly thinks she knows what that
            could be. Some models of centaurs suggest they contain amorphous
            water ice -- a type of ice without crystalline structure that
            can form only in very cold environments, and never here on
            Earth. Amorphous ice can trap gases like carbon monoxide between
            its molecules -- and Lilly suggests centaur activity is caused
            at relatively low temperatures by the trapped gases released by
            the transition of water ice from its amorphous to its
            crystalline form, rather than by the direct sublimation of ices.
            Comets aren't active until they're relatively near the sun, but
            the amorphous to crystalline transition of water ice can happen
            as far out as the orbit of Saturn -- about 890 million miles
            from the sun. The release of gases from the transition could
            cause sinkholes or landslides on the centaur's surface, in turn
            exposing chemically lightweight ices that sublimate in even
            feeble sunshine in a sudden outburst or explosion: "There have
            been centaurs in the past where we've seen this process," Lilly
            said. "This is what we think is happening." Lisse, whose
            research has included a study of centaurs, comets and Kuiper
            Belt objects with the Spitzer space telescope, said centaurs
            have only a few million years before they fall into a giant
            planet -- usually Jupiter -- or sneak into the inner solar
            system to become comets. The lighter ices forming the bulk of
            the comets are then sublimed near the sun -- "burned away," as
            he put it -- while the centaurs between Jupiter and Neptune
            still have much the same chemical composition as they did in the
            Kuiper Belt. That means that studying centaurs with spectroscopy
            or even space missions can give insights into the solar system's
            original composition: "I'm trying to figure out the recipe for
            the things that built the planets," Lisse said. "I want to know
            what was the original source."

              <h1>Are black holes time machines? Yes, but there's a catch.</h1>
              <p>
                Black holes form natural time machines that allow travel to both
                the past and the future. But don’t expect to be heading back to
                visit the dinosaurs any time soon. At present, we don’t have
                spacecraft that could get us anywhere near a black hole. But,
                even leaving that small detail aside, attempting to travel into
                the past using a black hole might be the last thing you ever do.
                What are black holes? A black hole is an extremely massive
                object that is typically formed when a dying star collapses in
                on itself. Like planets and stars, black holes have
                gravitational fields around them. A gravitational field is what
                keeps us stuck to Earth, and what keeps Earth revolving around
                the Sun. As a rule of thumb, the more massive an object is, the
                stronger its gravitational field. Earth’s gravitational field
                makes it extremely difficult to get to space. That’s why we
                build rockets: we have to travel very fast to break out of
                Earth’s gravity. The gravitational field of a black hole is so
                strong that even light can’t escape it. That’s impressive, since
                light is the fastest thing known to science! Incidentally,
                that’s why black holes are black: we can’t bounce light off a
                black hole the way we might bounce a torch light off a tree in
                the dark. Related Stories Digantara launches second satellite to
                monitor space weather Through its platform, Digantara develops
                end-to-end infrastructure to address the difficulties in space
                operations READ NOW Stretching space Albert Einstein’s general
                theory of relativity tells us matter and energy have a curious
                effect on the universe. Matter and energy bend and stretch
                space. The more massive an object is, the more space is
                stretched and bent around it. A massive object creates a kind of
                valley in space. When objects come near, they fall into the
                valley. That’s why, when you get close enough to any massive
                object, including a black hole, you fall toward it. It’s also
                why light can’t escape a black hole: the sides of the valley are
                so steep that light isn’t going fast enough to climb out. The
                valley created by a black hole gets steeper and steeper as you
                approach it from a distance. The point at which it gets so steep
                that light can’t escape is called the event horizon. Event
                horizons aren’t just interesting for would-be time travellers:
                they’re also interesting for philosophers because they have
                implications for how we understand the nature of time.
                Stretching time When space is stretched, so is time. A clock
                that is near a massive object will tick slower than one that is
                near a much less massive object. A clock near a black hole will
                tick very slowly compared to one on Earth. One year near a black
                hole could mean 80 years on Earth, as you may have seen
                illustrated in the movie Interstellar. In this way, black holes
                can be used to travel to the future. If you want to jump into
                the future of Earth, simply fly near a black hole and then
                return to Earth. If you get close enough to the centre of the
                black hole, your clock will tick slower, but you should still be
                able to escape so long as you don’t cross the event horizon.
                Loops in time What about the past? This is where things get
                truly interesting. A black hole bends time so much that it can
                wrap back on itself. Imagine taking a sheet of paper and joining
                the two ends to form a loop. That’s what a black hole seems to
                do to time. This creates a natural time machine. If you could
                somehow get onto the loop, which physicists call a closed
                timelike curve, you would find yourself on a trajectory through
                space that starts in the future and ends in the past. Inside the
                loop, you would also find that cause and effect get hard to
                untangle. Things that are in the past cause things to happen in
                the future, which in turn cause things to happen in the past!
                The catch So, you’ve found a black hole and you want to use your
                trusty spaceship to go back and visit the dinosaurs. Good luck.
                There are three problems. First, you can only travel into the
                black hole’s past. That means that if the black hole was created
                after the dinosaurs died out, then you won’t be able to go back
                far enough. Second, you’d probably have to cross the event
                horizon to get into the loop. This means that to get out of the
                loop at a particular time in the past, you’d need to exit the
                event horizon. That means travelling faster than light, which
                we’re pretty sure is impossible.

                NASA, Pentagon developing nuclear-powered rocket for Mars voyage
              </h1>
              <p>

                (AFP) Washington, United States ● Thu, January 26, 2023 NASA is
                partnering with a Pentagon research agency to develop a
                nuclear-powered rocket engine in preparation for sending
                astronauts to Mars. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday
                that the US space agency will team up with the Defense Advanced
                Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to "develop and demonstrate
                advanced nuclear thermal propulsion technology as soon as 2027."
                "With the help of this new technology, astronauts could journey
                to and from deep space faster than ever –- a major capability to
                prepare for crewed missions to Mars," Nelson said in a
                statement. DARPA is the Pentagon's research and development arm
                and has played a role in many of the notable innovations of the
                20th century including the internet. NASA said nuclear thermal
                rockets can be three or more times more efficient than
                conventional chemical propulsion and would reduce transit time,
                essential for an eventual mission to Mars. In a nuclear thermal
                engine, a fission reactor is used to generate extremely high
                temperatures. Heat from the reactor is transferred to liquid
                propellant which is then converted into gas, which expands
                through a nozzle and provides thrust. "DARPA and NASA have a
                long history of fruitful collaboration," DARPA director Stefanie
                Tompkins said, citing the Saturn V rocket that took the first
                astronauts to the Moon. "The nuclear thermal rocket program will
                be essential for more efficiently and quickly transporting
                material to the Moon and, eventually, people to Mars," Tompkins
                said. NASA conducted its last nuclear thermal rocket engine
                tests more than 50 years ago but the program was abandoned due
                to budget cuts and Cold War tensions.

              <h1>Global timekeepers vote to scrap leap second by 2035</h1>
              <p>
                Scientists and government representatives meeting at a
                conference in France voted on Friday to scrap leap seconds by
                2035, the organization responsible for global timekeeping said.
                Similar to leap years, leap seconds have been periodically added
                to clocks over the last half century to make up for the
                difference between exact atomic time and the Earth's slower
                rotation. While leap seconds pass by unnoticed for most people,
                they can cause problems for a range of systems that require an
                exact, uninterrupted flow of time, such as satellite navigation,
                software, telecommunication, trade and even space travel. It has
                caused a headache for the International Bureau of Weights and
                Measures (BIPM), which is responsible for Coordinated Universal
                Time (UTC)—the internationally agreed standard by which the
                world sets its clocks. A resolution to stop adding leap seconds
                by 2035 was passed by the BIPM's 59 member states and other
                parties at the General Conference on Weights and Measures, which
                is held roughly every four years at the Versailles Palace west
                of Paris. The head of BIPM's time department, Patrizia Tavella,
                told AFP that the "historic decision" would allow "a continuous
                flow of seconds without the discontinuities currently caused by
                irregular leap seconds". "The change will be effective by or
                before 2035," she said via email. She said that Russia voted
                against the resolution, "not on principle", but because Moscow
                wanted to push the date it comes into force until 2040. Other
                countries had called for a quicker timeframe such as 2025 or
                2030, so the "best compromise" was 2035, she said. The United
                States and France were among the countries leading the way for
                the change. Tavella emphasized that "the connection between UTC
                and the rotation of the Earth is not lost". "Nothing will
                change" for the public, she added. A leap minute? Seconds were
                long measured by astronomers analyzing the Earth's rotation,
                however the advent of atomic clocks—which use the frequency of
                atoms as their tick-tock mechanism—ushered in a far more precise
                era of timekeeping. But Earth's slightly slower rotation means
                the two times are out of sync. To bridge the gap, leap seconds
                were introduced in 1972, and 27 have been added at irregular
                intervals since—the last in 2016. Under the proposal, leap
                seconds will continue to be added as normal for the time being.
                But by 2035, the difference between atomic and astronomical time
                will be allowed to grow to a value larger than one second, Judah
                Levine, a physicist at the US National Institute of Standards
                and Technology, told AFP. "The larger value is yet to be
                determined," said Levine, who spent years helping draft the
                resolution alongside Tavella. Negotiations will be held to find
                a proposal by 2035 to determine that value and how it will be
                handled, according to the resolution. Levine said it was
                important to protect UTC time because it is run by "a worldwide
                community effort" in the BIPM. GPS time, a potential UTC rival
                governed by atomic clocks, is run by the US military "without
                worldwide oversight", Levine said. A possible solution to the
                problem could be letting the discrepancy between the Earth's
                rotation and atomic time build up to a minute. It is difficult
                to say exactly how long that might take, but Levine estimated
                anywhere between 50 to 100 years. Instead of then adding on a
                leap minute to clocks, Levine proposed a "kind of smear", in
                which the last minute of the day takes two minutes. "The advance
                of a clock slows, but never stops," he said.

                A novel, space-time coding antenna promotes 6G and secure
                wireless communications
              </h1>
              <p>
                A research team co-led by a scientist at City University of Hong
                Kong (CityU) has developed a novel antenna that allows
                manipulation of the direction, frequency and amplitude of the
                radiated beam, and is expected to play an important role in the
                integration of sensing and communications (ISAC) for
                6th-generation (6G) wireless communications. advertisement The
                structure and characteristics of traditional antennas cannot be
                changed once fabricated. However, the direction, frequency, and
                amplitude of the electromagnetic waves from this new-generation
                antenna, which is called a "sideband-free space-time-coding
                (STC) metasurface antenna," can be changed through space-time
                coding (i.e. software control), enabling great user flexibility.
                The key to this innovative feature is that the response of the
                metasurface (artificial, thin-sheet material with sub-wavelength
                thickness and made of several sub-wavelength meta-atoms) can be
                changed by switching the meta-atoms on its surface between
                radiating and non-radiating states, like turning on and off
                switches, by controlling the electric current. This allows the
                STC metasurface antenna to realize complicated wave manipulation
                in the space and frequency domains through software control, and
                to create a desired radiation pattern and a highly directed
                beam. Professor Chan Chi-hou, Acting Provost and Chair Professor
                of Electronic Engineering in the Department of Electrical
                Engineering at CityU, who led the research, highlighted that the
                antenna relies on the successful combination of two research
                advances, namely amplitude-modulated (AM) leaky-wave antennas
                and space-time coding techniques. Dr Wu Gengbo, postdoctoral
                fellow in the State Key Laboratory of Terahertz and Millimeter
                Waves (SKLTMW) at CityU, first proposed the new concept of AM
                leaky-wave antennas in 2020 in his PhD studies at CityU. "The
                concept provides an analytical approach to synthesize antennas
                with the desired radiation patterns for different specific uses
                by simply changing the antennas' shape and structure," explained
                Dr Wu. But as with other antennas, once the AM leaky-wave
                antenna is fabricated, its radiation characteristics are fixed.
                At about that time, Dr Dai Junyan, from a research group led by
                Academician Cui Tiejun and Professor Cheng Qiang, from Southeast
                University at Nanjing, China, who pioneered STC technologies,
                joined Professor Chan's group at CityU. "Dr Dai's expertise in
                space-time coding and digital metasurfaces to dynamically
                reconfigure antenna performance added a new, important dimension
                to the antenna research at the SKLTMW," said Professor Chan, who
                is also Director of the SKLTMW at CityU.

                A Bacterial Enzyme That Copies DNA Might Make More Mistakes in
                Zero Gravity, Study Finds
              </h1>
              <p>
                An enzyme in the bacterium E. coli made more errors copying
                synthetic DNA when exposed to zero gravity than the same enzyme
                did in normal gravity, a recent study finds. The paper raises
                the possibility that some enzymes work differently in space
                compared to on Earth. "It gives us an idea that enzymes, like
                polymerases or others that are involved in maintaining the
                integrity of our DNA, may be influenced by spaceflight," said
                Susan Bailey, a radiation cancer biologist at Colorado State
                University in Fort Collins who has studied DNA damage caused by
                space radiation and did not contribute to the new paper. Aaron
                Rosenstein, lead author of the paper and a bioengineering
                graduate student at the University of Toronto, said the finding
                "warrants further investigation into other enzymes that are
                involved in crucial pathways that are inherent to life and
                survival." Scientists know that spending long periods of time in
                space can affect astronauts' physiology and cause health
                problems. Microgravity can cause muscle atrophy, a loss of bone
                density, and vision problems. It can also cause the brain and
                cerebrospinal fluid to shift, and it might be linked to brain
                damage. While in space, astronauts are also exposed to radiation
                from the sun and distant galaxies. "Radiation kind of acts like
                a bowling ball, and the DNA is the bowling pins," said
                Rosenstein. "These particles move so fast that they break DNA
                apart or they cause mutations through all these different
                mechanisms." This damage to DNA can potentially put astronauts
                at increased risk for cancer and degenerative diseases, said
                Bailey. Rosenstein said it's less clear what effect, if any,
                microgravity might have on DNA. He studies DNA polymerases, a
                class of enzymes that copy DNA and repair damage. Polymerases
                read the order in which the four types of nucleotide bases are
                arranged on the original strand of DNA and place the matching
                base on the corresponding section of the new strand. But these
                polymerases aren't perfect, so some have proofreading enzymes
                attached that double-check their work and note where they've
                made a mistake.

                Spinning Propeller Star Slingshots Plasma at 7 Million MPH
              </h1>
              <p>
                Astronomers have detected the fastest-spinning white dwarf star
                found yet -- one that researchers say acts like an
                extraordinarily powerful magnetic propeller, a new study finds.
                White dwarfs are stars that have burnt up all their fuel and
                shed their outer layers, leaving behind their cool, dim cores.
                Our sun will one day become a white dwarf, as will more than 90%
                of the stars in the Milky Way. In the new study, researchers
                analyzed the white dwarf in the binary star system LAMOST
                J024048.51+195226.9. The white dwarf is a stellar remnant about
                2,015 light-years from Earth that is roughly our planet's size
                but at least 230,000 times its mass. The researchers imaged the
                spinning of the star using the highly sensitive HiPERCAM
                instrument on the largest functioning optical telescope in the
                world, the 10-meter-wide Gran Telescopio Canarias in Spain's
                Canary Islands. The white dwarf's powerful gravity yanks plasma
                off its larger companion, a red dwarf star. In the past, this
                material fell onto the white dwarf's equator at high speed,
                resulting in its extraordinarily fast spin. The white dwarf also
                possesses a strong magnetic field, which acts like a protective
                barrier that causes most of the plasma falling onto it to blast
                out from the dead star at speeds of roughly 6.7 million mph.
                This makes this stellar remnant only the second "magnetic
                propeller" white dwarf ever found, more than 70 years since the
                first. Any plasma that doesn't get propelled away from
                J0240+1952 flows toward the white dwarf's magnetic poles. It
                gathers in bright spots on the white dwarf's surface, and as
                these rotate in and out of view from Earth, astronomers observe
                pulses of light, which they use to measure the white dwarf's
                rate of spin. All in all, the white dwarf completes one full
                rotation in a record-breaking 25 seconds. That is nearly 20%
                faster than the next fastest-spinning white dwarf, which
                completes a revolution in just over 29 seconds. "Put into
                Earth's perspective, it is like the day only lasted for 25
                seconds," said study lead author Ingrid Pelisoli, an
                astrophysicist at the University of Warwick in England. These
                findings help support theoretical predictions of how magnetic
                propellers should behave, which scientists had not been able to
                confirm until they found a second example of one. "I find it
                very satisfactory to find exactly what you expected," Pelisoli
                said. The scientists detailed their findings online Nov. 22 in
                the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

              <h1>Our Solar System's Centaurs Are Half-Asteroid, Half-Comet</h1>
              <p>
                Centaurs are among the strangest objects in the solar system.
                The first, dubbed Chiron, was spotted orbiting more than a
                billion miles from the sun in 1977 and was originally thought to
                be an asteroid. But a few years later it was seen emitting a
                halo of gas -- a "coma" -- and a tail like a comet. This dual
                nature gave these weird objects their name: Seemingly
                half-asteroid and half-comet, they were dubbed "centaurs" after
                the half-human, half-horse creatures of Greek myths. More than a
                thousand centaurs have now been found, and scientists have
                discovered a little more about them, although at such distances
                they remain mysterious. But centaurs may hold a key to
                understanding how the sun and its planets originally formed from
                clouds of interstellar gas. Although the full journey hasn't yet
                been seen, scientists think centaurs start out as Kuiper Belt
                objects, or KBOs -- the "dirty snowballs," now thought to be as
                much dirt as snow, that orbit the sun far beyond Neptune –
                between 2.7 billion and 4.6 billion miles from the sun.
                Scientists estimate there are millions of KBOs; many are less
                than 10 miles across but some are much larger, and the
                designation includes Pluto and other distant dwarf planets that
                are thought to have formed when multitudes of smaller KBOs
                clumped together. KBOs are interesting to scientists in part
                because they are thought to be the frozen remnants of the
                protoplanetary disk of dust and gas that formed our solar
                system. "I like to call them the dinosaur bones of the solar
                system," said planetary astronomer Carey Lisse of Johns Hopkins
                University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.
                "They are roughly equal amounts of ices and rock, which is what
                we think is the original recipe for building the planets." Most
                KBOs are so small and so distant that they are difficult to
                study. But any KBOs that get closer to the sun -- such as
                centaurs -- can give scientists a better chance to observe them
                and better understand the formation of the entire solar system,
                Lisse said. Most centaurs are dislodged from the Kuiper Belt by
                the gravity of Neptune and may take millions of years to spiral
                into the "centaur zone" between Neptune and Jupiter. Once there
                they can ricochet between the giant planets. "You can kind of
                imagine it as a giant pinball machine," explained Eva Lilly, a
                research scientist for the Planetary Science Institute who lives
                in South Carolina. "They get passed around between one of the
                big planets, from Neptune to Uranus, then from Uranus to Saturn,
                and so on -- and each of these interactions can alter their
                orbits more and more." Lilly is the lead author of a study
                published recently in the Planetary Science Journal that
                examined 13 of the closest centaurs to learn about their
                often-sporadic cometlike activity. "They are really
                unpredictable," she said. "We don't really know when they will
                turn on and turn off." Just as Sherlock Holmes once solved a
                mystery because a dog didn't bark, Lilly found a clue about the
                centaurs' composition from their lack of activity. Although the
                centaurs were observed near their closest approach to the sun,
                they didn't show any cometlike behavior -- which suggests their
                occasional activity is triggered by something other than the sun
                directly heating up their ice until it turns into vapor, a
                process called sublimation. And Lilly thinks she knows what that
                could be. Some models of centaurs suggest they contain amorphous
                water ice -- a type of ice without crystalline structure that
                can form only in very cold environments, and never here on
                Earth. Amorphous ice can trap gases like carbon monoxide between
                its molecules -- and Lilly suggests centaur activity is caused
                at relatively low temperatures by the trapped gases released by
                the transition of water ice from its amorphous to its
                crystalline form, rather than by the direct sublimation of ices.
                Comets aren't active until they're relatively near the sun, but
                the amorphous to crystalline transition of water ice can happen
                as far out as the orbit of Saturn -- about 890 million miles
                from the sun. The release of gases from the transition could
                cause sinkholes or landslides on the centaur's surface, in turn
                exposing chemically lightweight ices that sublimate in even
                feeble sunshine in a sudden outburst or explosion: "There have
                been centaurs in the past where we've seen this process," Lilly
                said. "This is what we think is happening." Lisse, whose
                research has included a study of centaurs, comets and Kuiper
                Belt objects with the Spitzer space telescope, said centaurs
                have only a few million years before they fall into a giant
                planet -- usually Jupiter -- or sneak into the inner solar
                system to become comets. The lighter ices forming the bulk of
                the comets are then sublimed near the sun -- "burned away," as
                he put it -- while the centaurs between Jupiter and Neptune
                still have much the same chemical composition as they did in the
                Kuiper Belt. That means that studying centaurs with spectroscopy
                or even space missions can give insights into the solar system's
                original composition: "I'm trying to figure out the recipe for
                the things that built the planets," Lisse said. "I want to know
                what was the original source."
